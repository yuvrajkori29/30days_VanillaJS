    const l = 10;

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    const team = players;

    console.table(team);

    // and we want to make a copy of it.


    // You might think we can just do something like this:

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    
    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
  const newArr = [].concat(players);

  console.log(newArr);
    // or use the new ES6 Spread
const spreadArr = [...players];
console.log(spreadArr);
    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
spreadArr[3]="hwllo";
console.table(spreadArr);
console.table(players);


spreadArr.forEach((e)=>{
    console.log(e);
});


    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    const obj = person;

    obj.number = 100;

    console.log(person);   //number is being added ....
    // and think we make a copy:


    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const copyPerson = Object.assign({},person,{number:99});
    console.table(copyPerson);
    console.table(person);

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    const spreadObj = {...person}; 

    spreadObj.number = 102;       //workig correctly showinff 100 beecaouse of above staemnts 

    console.log(person);
    console.log(spreadObj);

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
